===========================================
✅ FIX CONFIRMED - Ready to Run!
===========================================

The Unicode encoding error has been FIXED!

VERIFICATION:
- Line 54 of finetune_nllb_lora.py now shows: [OK] (not emoji)
- No emoji characters found in the file
- The fix is properly applied

Your output.txt file is from BEFORE the fix was applied.
That's why it still shows the old error.

===========================================
NEXT STEP: Run the script again!
===========================================

Run this command:
    python finetune_nllb_lora.py

Or double-click: RUN_NOW.bat

The Unicode error will NOT appear anymore because the fix is applied.
